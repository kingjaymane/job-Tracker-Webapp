IMPORTANT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
=============================

1. Go to Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your JobTracker project
3. Click "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
4. Click the "Rules" tab
5. Replace the existing rules with the rules above
6. Click "Publish" 
7. Wait 1-2 minutes for the rules to propagate

SECURITY EXPLANATION:
====================

These rules ensure that:
- Users can only access their own data
- Job applications can only be accessed by their owner (userId field)
- User documents can only be accessed by the user themselves
- All operations require authentication

DEBUGGING TIPS:
===============

If you get permission errors:
1. Check that you're signed in to Firebase Auth
2. Verify the userId matches the authenticated user
3. Check the Firestore console for rule evaluation logs
4. Temporarily use the broad rule above for debugging
*/
- Authentication is required for all operations
- No user can read or modify another user's job data
- The structure follows: users/{userId}/jobs/{jobId}

TESTING THE RULES:
==================

After updating the rules, test them by:
1. Opening browser console on your JobTracker app
2. Running: testFirestoreAccess('your-user-id')
3. Should return success without permission errors

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

If you still get permission errors:
1. Make sure you're signed in to the app
2. Check that your user ID matches the Firestore path
3. Wait a few minutes for rules to propagate
4. Try refreshing the page and signing in again
5. Check Firebase Console → Authentication to see if user exists
